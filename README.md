# Haley Schafer Portfolio
Stream One Project: User Centric Frontend Development - Code Institute 

This is my portfolio website to present to prospective employers. The portfolio highlights six projects that cover a range of technologies, as well as including a bit about myself, my coding skills, and a contact form. As I am bilingual, it has both an English and a French version.


## Demo
A live demo can be found [here](https://code-institute-solutions.github.io/StudentExampleProjectGradeFour).


## UX
My goal in the design was to make it as easy as possible to access information on the site, while striving for a minimalist design. The greyscale color scheme was chosen to create a sleek and modern feel.


## Technologies
1. HTML
2. CSS
3. Bootstrap (3.3.7)


## Features
This site uses the scrollSpy feature in Bootstrap. The navbar also stays collapsed regardless of the screen size.


## Testing
This site was tested across multiple browsers and on multiple mobile devices to ensure compatibility and responsiveness.


## Deployment 
This site is hosted using GitHub pages, deployed directly from the master branch.

### Content
All content in the "About Me/À Propos" and "Work/Travail" sections in this portfolio site were written by me. 

### Media 
All photos were taken from [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/), a stock image library, with the exception of the photo of myself in the background of the 'about me/À Propos' section in the desktop view. A greyscale filter was applied to each one prior to upload to preserve the greyscale theme. 

### Acknowledgements

The progress circles from the skills section are modeled after the following Stack Overflow [example](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14222138/css-progress-circle). They were significantly modified to fit the styling, sizing, and progress for each skill.

The media query for the collapsed navbar regardless of viewport width was taken from this [site](https://www.codeply.com/go/iaM1zcNsQB/bootstrap-navbar-always-collapsed).

**This is for educational use.**
